The software uses MPI and dronekit to allow a set of vehicles (drones, rovers, etc) to move as a bird's swarm using a simplified version of the [Vicsek model](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjb/e2008-00275-9). 

Each vehicle is to be executed on an independent computer, virtual machine, etc., running [ArduPilot SITL](http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop.html). Moreover, all the computers are to be set as a [High Performance Robotic Computing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092188901830232X) Cluster
